Observable trends:

The most common players are within the age of 20-24. Not only that, but they offer a decent average purchase price based on the actions. They should be considered the main target for the game, as they offer the most money overall, even in they do not average out to be the largest.

As a further note, 84.03% of the players are male. This can bring the core audience to be male players between the age of 20-24. Further data can be reviewed to determine why the items this dataset purchased was the most popular to ensure similar items are offered in order to maximize profitability.

A final unique note is that lower pricing does not mean higher quantity purchased. The most popular items are actually on the more expensive end. This refers further to the idea of looking into the quality of the item to determine what needs to be offered later on in the game.
